*  🌎 I love learning about all different areas of knowledge because everything intrigues me and I love to learn. 
*  🎥  As a follow up to my first point, my favorite thing to watch are documentaries since they educate the viewers. 
*  📖 My favorite thing to do in my free time is read. 
*  ⚽️ I love playing any and all sports but I sadly do not have enough time to play them anymore. 
*   I'm very excited to learn how to code since it is the language of the future so I can't wait to see what I learn from this course.
